# FisicaComputacional2
Work done during my second undergraduate course on computational physics.

The main language used during the course is Matlab. The featured work consists of:

- Simple examples of loops to get acquainted with the language to be used.
- Root approximation of functions through several implementations.
- Numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations (ODE)
- Simulation of light transmission through optic fiber.
- Numerical solution to the Maxwell equations and calculation of the reflection coefficient under specific electric properties of a material using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method.
- Phase unwrapping and image filtering through Fourier transform.
